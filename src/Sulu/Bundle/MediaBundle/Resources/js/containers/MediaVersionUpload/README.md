This component shows a thumbnail of the recent version of the uploaded media.
Besides that, two buttons are rendered below which allow to open either the `FocusPointOverlay` or the `CropOverlay`. 
The `FocusPointOverlay` makes it possible to set a focus point within the uploaded media element and the 
`CropOverlay` provides a typical crop functionality.

A `ResourceStore` component has to be passed so the component knows which locale, id and so on to use.
